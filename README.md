# Selling Masks in the Pandemic Times
This repository is a data visualization project of the masks sold on an online store in pandemic times.

a) Data Cleaning

The first step is to clean the data named 'EtsySoldOrderItems2020.csv'.
Run the Jupyter Notebook 'Data Cleaning.ipynb' to clean the data and save it in a new csv file named 'DataCleaned.csv'.
The file 'NewItemNames.xlsx' is used to replace the item names to optimized names.

b) Mask Study

The second step is to visualize some of the data related to the masks sold in the store. This can be done by running the Jupyter notebook 
code 'Masks Analysis.ipynb'.
